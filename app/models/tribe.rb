  # The following three methods assume tribes can build more than one building
  # of a single type. The reason I went with this method of multiple-
  # same-object-association (That's not a term, Keegan. Yeah, I know, Keegan.)
  # instead of the model I have with resources (being that each resource is like
  # a commodity, e.g. there are a finite and 'real' number of pieces of iron,
  # they can be created, traded, or destroyed. Not just the references to them,
  # but the records/objects themselves) is that a resource just has a name,
  # and is a very simple record, whereas a building is meant to be more complex,
  # with a multi-variable cost, and extra attributes planned for the future. So,
  # I think it makes more sense to store multiple records of the association a
  # tribe has to the building type, rather than store multiple records of the
  # building type for every building the tribe builds. By storing multiple
  # identical records in the "join table"-esque tribe_buildings table, each
  # tribe_building has an id, and is itself only a three-column record of only
  # integers, which is a lot less data than storing a new building every time.
  # The other main difference is that a building is not meant to be transferred
  # between two tribes. It may be destroyed in raids, or maybe dismantled for
  # parts, but it's an immovable object that has a "type".
  # Although, one of the reasons I DISLIKE this way of doing things is that
  # when I want to count each building type in a tribe, I have to make two
  # database queries: one to get the building id from the name, and a second
  # to actually count the tribe_building records in tribe_buildings.
  # You also need to reload the tribe object if you want to access the tribe's
  # buildings after adding one, since it is manually adding records to the child
  # table. If you use the reload_object optional argument on #build_building or
  # #add_building, you can force a reload of the object afterward (but only if
  # the building was successfully added).
